# leaf-infection-classifier
This GitHub repository contains a comprehensive supervised machine learning project for accurately classifying plant diseases using Python. Leveraging the power of computer vision, we have employed CV2 (OpenCV), along with pandas, numpy, and matplotlib, for robust data preprocessing, exploration, and visualization.

Project Highlights:

Data Preprocessing: We prioritize data quality by performing thorough image processing and manipulation using CV2. Additionally, pandas and numpy enable seamless data handling, ensuring our model's efficiency.

Model Training: Our classifier achieves impressive results by employing Keras and TensorFlow with the powerful VGG19 architecture. This pre-trained model has been fine-tuned on a vast dataset of plant disease images, empowering it to recognize various diseases with remarkable accuracy.

Web Deployment: Experience the ease of plant disease identification through our intuitive web interface. Built with the Flask web framework, our deployment enables users to conveniently interact with the classifier, empowering farmers and botanists in diagnosing crop diseases.
